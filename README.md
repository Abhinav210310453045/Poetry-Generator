# Poetry-Generator
- This project aims to generate poetry by using second-order Markov Models by calculating the Posterior of the tri-gram of the words in the lines of the poetry
- Worked well with other languages also. I have tried with the Hindi & Urdu poetry.
- Currently the  notebook Poetry_Generator.ipynb runs for the Hindi & Urdu Poetry.
- To Run the code for the English Poetry, Store the Data of the Poems by Edgar Allan Poe or Robert Frost inside the Data Frame ( given as a comment in the Notebook itself) and Uncomment the 5th line inside cell no 28 of the Jupyter Notebook.
